About Internet Explorer "friendly" error message

When you access Web pages from Internet Explorer, the actual text of an HTTP 500 message that is
sent to the browser may be masked by an Internet Explorer "friendly" error message. 
Although you can turn off this feature manually for each client, this article also provides several
server-side workarounds to inhibit the display of "friendly" error messages.

Several frequently-seen status codes have "friendly" error messages that Internet Explorer displays
and that effectively mask the actual text message that the server sends. However, these "friendly"
error messages are only displayed if the response that is sent to the client is less than or equal
to a specified threshold. For example, to see the exact text of an HTTP 500 response, the content
length must be greater than 512 bytes.
